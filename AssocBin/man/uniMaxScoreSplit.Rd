\title{Univariate score maximizing splitting}
\usage{
uniMaxScoreSplit(bin, scorer = diff, pickMax = which.max, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{bin}{a bin to be split with elements `x`, `y`, `depth`,
`bnds` (list with elements `x` and `y`), `expn`, `n`}

\item{scorer}{function which accepts a numeric vector of potential
split coordinates and the bounds of `bin` and returns a numeric
vector of scores for each}

\item{pickMax}{function which accepts a list of scores and returns
the element of the largest score according to some rule}

\item{...}{optional additional arguments to `scorer`}
}
\value{
A list of two bins resulting from the split of `bin` at
the maximum split location along x
}
\description{
A function which splits a bin based on the location
maximizing a score function.
}
\details{
This function is the univariate version of
`maxScoreSplit` and so is considerably simpler. It assumes the
variable to be split is named `x` in the bin, and the other
variable is to remain unsplit.
}
\examples{
bin <- list(x = 1:10, y = sample(1:10),
            bnds = list(x = c(0, 10), y = c(0, 10)),
            expn = 10, n = 10, depth = 0)
bin2 <- halfSplit(bin, "x")
uniMaxScoreSplit(bin2[[1]])
uniMaxScoreSplit(bin2[[1]], scorer = randScores)
